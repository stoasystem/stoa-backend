- Enforced parent ownership before child-specific data reads and preserved explicit legacy route compatibility.
- Aligned frontend parent services and pages to real backend route shapes without silent demo fallback.
- Added available, empty, missing, and error states across parent-critical frontend flows.
- Verified backend parent behavior with 50 tests and frontend parent flows with focused Playwright coverage.
