# Milestones

## Completed

### v1.0 Parent Portal Real Data Integration

**Status:** Shipped 2026-06-02
**Audit:** `.planning/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`
**Roadmap archive:** `.planning/milestones/v1.0-ROADMAP.md`
**Requirements archive:** `.planning/milestones/v1.0-REQUIREMENTS.md`
**Phases:** 5
**Plans:** 11
**Requirements:** 38/38 v1 requirements complete

Key accomplishments:

- Added normal parent portal `/parents/me/...` backend routes for child list, summary, history, latest report, and week-specific report lookups.
- Enforced parent ownership before child-specific data reads and preserved explicit legacy route compatibility.
- Aligned frontend parent services and pages to real backend route shapes without silent demo fallback.
- Added available, empty, missing, and error states across parent-critical frontend flows.
- Verified backend parent behavior with 50 tests and frontend parent flows with focused Playwright coverage.

Known deferred items at close: 4 (see `.planning/v1.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` tech debt).

### v1.1 Weekly Report Automation

**Status:** Shipped 2026-06-02
**Audit:** `.planning/v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md`
**Roadmap archive:** `.planning/milestones/v1.1-ROADMAP.md`
**Requirements archive:** `.planning/milestones/v1.1-REQUIREMENTS.md`
**Phases:** 8
**Plans:** 8
**Requirements:** 34/34 v1.1 requirements complete

Key accomplishments:

- Added CDK-backed scheduled weekly report Lambda infrastructure with EventBridge Scheduler, permissions, DLQ, and monitoring.
- Built weekly learning aggregation, parent-facing Bedrock report generation with deterministic fallback, and report artifact storage.
- Stored generated report metadata and full HTML/JSON artifacts before SES delivery completion.
- Added idempotent scheduled orchestration for linked parent/student report generation.
- Exposed generated, missing, pending, failed, and email-failed report states through the parent API and frontend.
- Verified backend and frontend report flows with focused pytest, ruff, Playwright, and lint coverage.

Known deferred items at close: 5 follow-up candidates (see `.planning/v1.1-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md` residual risks and follow-ups).

### v1.2 S3 Report Artifact Infrastructure

**Status:** Shipped 2026-06-04 after live AWS verification
**Roadmap:** `.planning/ROADMAP.md`
**Requirements:** `.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md`
**Phases:** 5
**Plans:** 5
**Requirements:** 31/31 v1.2 requirements complete

Key accomplishments:

- Verified the deployed reports bucket is private, encrypted, access-blocked, retained in CDK, and wired into both Lambda functions.
- Locked the canonical artifact key contract as `weekly-reports/{parent_id}/{student_id}/{week_start}/report.{json,html}`.
- Added helper-backed JSON/HTML artifact writes and reads with tests for content type, safe key inputs, and no S3 ACL usage.
- Preserved storage ordering so report metadata and email delivery only proceed after artifact writes succeed.
- Ran deployed Lambda private-object smoke on 2026-06-04; `stoa-weekly-report` wrote and read back a private JSON object under the canonical prefix.

Known deferred items at close: report bucket `enforce_ssl`, prefix-scoped IAM, smoke/orphan lifecycle cleanup, and report operations tooling.
