# STOA Backend

## What This Is

STOA is a learning platform backend for students, teachers/tutors, parents, and admins. This repository provides the FastAPI service that runs locally with Uvicorn and in production as an AWS Lambda/API Gateway API backed by Cognito, DynamoDB, S3, Bedrock, Rekognition, SQS, and SES.

The v1.1 weekly report automation now generates weekly learning reports for linked parent/student pairs, stores generated report artifacts, sends parent emails, and renders generated report states in the parent portal.

## Core Value

Parents can trust that parent portal views reflect authorized real student data from the backend, not hidden demo fallbacks.

## Current State

**Shipped version:** v1.1 Weekly Report Automation on 2026-06-02

Delivered:

- Parent-owned child listing through `GET /parents/me/children`.
- Parent-owned child summary through `GET /parents/me/children/{child_id}/summary`.
- Parent-owned child learning history through `GET /parents/me/children/{child_id}/history`.
- Parent-owned report lookup through `GET /parents/me/children/{child_id}/report` and week-specific `GET /parents/me/children/{child_id}/reports/{week}`.
- Frontend parent services and pages use real backend route shapes and no longer silently hide parent-critical API failures behind demo fallback.
- Focused backend and frontend tests cover parent authorization, empty states, missing reports, and route contract alignment.
- CDK defines a scheduled weekly report Lambda, EventBridge Scheduler target, permissions, retry/DLQ behavior, and monitoring.
- Backend aggregates weekly student learning activity, generates parent-facing content with Bedrock and deterministic fallback, stores metadata/artifacts, and sends SES email.
- Scheduled orchestration is idempotent by `(parent_id, student_id, week_start)`.
- Parent API and frontend render generated, missing, pending, failed, and email-failed report states.
- Focused backend and frontend tests verify the report flow.

## Current Milestone

No active milestone. Start the next one with `$gsd-new-milestone`.

## Requirements

### Validated

Existing codebase capabilities inferred from the mapped backend:

- FastAPI backend is composed under `src/stoa/main.py` with route modules for auth, students, parents, practice, questions, conversations, teachers/tutors, admin, and files.
- Cognito JWT validation and role resolution exist in `src/stoa/deps.py`.
- DynamoDB single-table repositories exist for users, questions, practice, and reports.
- Student summary, student question history, practice progress, mistakes, and report storage are available as data sources for parent-visible aggregation.

Shipped requirements:

- Parent users can list only their linked children through `/parents/me/children` - v1.0.
- Parent users can open a linked child summary backed by real backend aggregation - v1.0.
- Parent users can open a linked child learning history backed by real backend data - v1.0.
- Parent users can open child report pages that distinguish available reports from missing reports without fabricated content - v1.0.
- Parent-critical frontend flows use real backend API contracts and do not silently fall back to demo data - v1.0.
- Authorization prevents parents, students, teachers, tutors, and admins from using normal parent routes outside their intended access rules - v1.0.
- Required infrastructure assumptions are confirmed against CDK before backend implementation - v1.0.
- Weekly report automation infrastructure, generation, storage, email delivery, API display, frontend rendering, and verification shipped - v1.1.

### Active

- [ ] Define the next milestone.

### Out of Scope

- Billing or paid subscription enforcement - not part of report automation MVP.
- PDF generation - HTML/JSON report artifacts are enough for this milestone.
- Multi-language report generation beyond the primary parent-facing language chosen for MVP.
- Stripe or billing integration - unrelated to parent real-data integration.
- Organization/school portal work - separate product surface.
- Real-time report generation on every parent page load - scheduled generation is the intended model.
- Manual admin report editor - follow-up operational feature.
- Live classroom work - separate product surface.
- Full admin analytics - separate admin analytics scope.
- Broad frontend redesign - v1.0 was integration and state correctness.

## Context

### Repositories

- Backend: `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-backend`
- Frontend: `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-frontend`
- Infrastructure/CDK: `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-infra`

### Backend Context

Relevant backend files:

- `src/stoa/routers/parents.py`
- `src/stoa/routers/students.py`
- `src/stoa/routers/practice.py`
- `src/stoa/db/repositories/user_repo.py`
- `src/stoa/db/repositories/question_repo.py`
- `src/stoa/db/repositories/report_repo.py`
- `src/stoa/db/repositories/practice_repo.py`
- `src/stoa/deps.py`

Current backend capabilities:

- Parent child listing exists through `/parents/me/children`.
- Child summary, learning history, latest report, and week-specific report lookups exist through `/parents/me/children/{child_id}/...`.
- Legacy `/parents/{parent_id}/...` child/report routes remain compatible for explicit legacy/admin use.
- Student summary, question history, practice progress, mistakes, conversations, and report storage are available as data sources for parent-visible aggregation.
- Weekly report aggregation, Bedrock/fallback generation, storage, email delivery, and scheduled job orchestration exist in backend services/jobs.

### Frontend Context

Relevant frontend files:

- `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-frontend/src/app/router/AppRouter.tsx`
- `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-frontend/src/pages/parent/`
- `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-frontend/src/services/parent/parentApi.ts`
- `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-frontend/src/services/parent/parentReportApi.ts`
- `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-frontend/src/services/demo/demoFallback.ts`

Current frontend state:

- Parent-critical child list, summary, history, and report services call `/parents/me/...` routes directly.
- Parent-critical pages render explicit loading, error, empty, missing, and available states.
- Demo fallback is no longer used for normal parent-critical child, summary, history, and report flows.

### Infrastructure Context

Relevant CDK files:

- `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-infra/stacks/auth_stack.py`
- `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-infra/stacks/database_stack.py`
- `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-infra/stacks/storage_stack.py`
- `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-infra/stacks/api_stack.py`
- `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-infra/stacks/notification_stack.py`
- `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-infra/stacks/monitoring_stack.py`

Known current resources:

- Cognito User Pool with app clients and role groups.
- DynamoDB single table with GSIs.
- S3 image/report/log buckets.
- Lambda FastAPI backend through API Gateway HTTP API.
- SQS FIFO teacher escalation queue.
- SES email identity.
- EventBridge schedule group and weekly report Lambda target exist in CDK.
- Infra CI builds `stoa-backend/dist` before CDK diff/deploy because Lambda assets are gitignored build artifacts.

## Constraints

- **Infrastructure first:** All new backend work must be checked against existing CDK in `/Users/zhdeng/stoa-infra` before implementation.
- **AWS resources:** Do not invent new AWS services, tables, buckets, Lambdas, queues, or indexes without proving current CDK/resources cannot support the need.
- **DynamoDB:** Reuse the existing single-table design unless a specific missing access pattern requires a new GSI.
- **CDK source of truth:** Any required infrastructure change must be implemented in CDK, not manually assumed.
- **Configuration:** Backend resource names and URLs must come from environment variables injected by CDK.
- **Frontend contract:** Frontend integration must target the real backend API contract and avoid silent demo fallback from parent-critical flows.
- **Authorization:** Every child-specific parent endpoint must verify ownership before reading or returning child data.

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Prefer `/parents/me/...` routes for parent portal flows | Parent identity is already available from JWT and clients should not pass parent IDs for normal logged-in parent workflows | Good - shipped in v1.0 |
| Keep existing path-ID parent endpoints compatible where useful | Existing routes may still serve legacy or internal use cases while the portal moves to `/parents/me/...` | Good - legacy compatibility preserved in v1.0 |
| Treat report generation as a follow-up milestone | v1.0 needed query/display/empty states, not scheduled generation, emails, or PDFs | Good - deferred to next milestone candidate |
| Check CDK before backend data-access changes | The milestone explicitly depended on current DynamoDB/Cognito/Lambda resource definitions | Good - Phase 1 created the evidence ledger |
| Use local DynamoDB parent profile `user_id` as canonical parent ownership ID | Cognito `sub` can differ from local user IDs used by existing records | Good - used by parent resolver and ownership checks |
| Remove `withDemoFallback` from parent-critical flows | Parent portal correctness depends on surfacing real backend failures instead of replacing them with demo data | Good - shipped in frontend integration |
| Prefer a separate scheduled Lambda handler for weekly reports | EventBridge Scheduler should not invoke the Mangum API handler directly | Good - shipped in v1.1 |
| Store generated report before email completion | Parents must still be able to view reports if SES delivery fails | Good - shipped in v1.1 |
